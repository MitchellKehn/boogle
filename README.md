# Boogle
A simple word game web app.
It is hosted [here](https://mitchellkehn.github.io/boogle/), 
and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/MitchellKehn/boogle).

**I am not a web developer**, and have never used Javascript or declarative UI frameworks before.
Adjust expectations accordingly. This is the result of a couple days of learning how to use ReactJS, 
mostly just for fun to see what it's like and to stave off the rising (but disappointingly flat) tides of boredom.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
